Project Timeline
Kinematic analysis


• Inverse kinematics was
  first solved to
  understand how actuator
  movements correspond to
  the desired platform
  motion.

• The goal of kinematic
  analysis is to identify
  the geometric
  configuration that meets
  the desired workspace
  criteria.
Dynamic analysis


• The dynamic analysis of the
  hexapod was conducted using
  Simscape to calculate motor
  requirements and measure the
  forces and moments
  transmitted through the
  members during operation.

•    These results were later
    used for component sizing and
    preliminary design.
Project Timeline
Preliminary design


A 3D model of the hexapod was
created in SolidWorks, using the
geometry derived from the
kinematic analysis as a
reference for the proper
positioning of components.
Project Timeline
Mechanical component
dimensioning

Mechanical components were sized
using first principal modeling,
and their design was verified
through SolidWorks simulations
to ensure functionality and
performance under operational
conditions.
Project Timeline
Usage of off-the-shelf
components

The platform will incorporate
Commercial Off-The-Shelf
components to streamline the
development process, minimizing
both time and cost
Project Timeline
Manufacturing & Assembly


The UBCO machine shop will be
used for the final design
consultation and manufacturing.
Project Timeline
Motor control testing


We plan to use a controller
based on the MIT Mini Cheetah
robot.
We have also developed an
additional controller as a back
up, which has been verified
using Simscape Multibody
simulation.
Project Timeline
System Integration

• We plan to develop a UI to control the
  platform.
  Target features so far are –
   • Trajectory execution,
   • Tuning,
   • Data logging,
   • E-stop.
Project Timeline
Full system testing

• The primary goal of this phase is to turn the
  prototype into a product that is essentially
  very user-friendly platform.

• Additionally, we will implement checks to
  ensure that the input trajectories remain
  within the hexapod’s workspace and the
  motors’ operational limits

• These limits can be determined from the
  kinematic and dynamic analysis that is
  already done.
Project Timeline
Design adjustments



 • There is a possibility that certain
   aspects of the input trajectory may not
   be achievable with the current
   configuration in practice.
 • To address these cases, we plan to
   implement mechanical solutions such as
   hard stops, non-linear springs and shock
   absorbers
